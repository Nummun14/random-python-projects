# random python projects
 These are random projects I decided to make when I started learning python. 
 Anytime I randomly make a small project I add it here. No matter how good or hard it is.
 
 some of the projects are unfinished, and a lot of them are done in a very inefficiant way.
 But these projects were key for me to get better at coding and I wanted a place to save them.
